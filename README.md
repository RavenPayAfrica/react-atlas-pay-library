## Installation:

````bash
npm install react-atlas-pay

or

```bash
yarn add react-atlas-pay
````

## Usage :

React Atlas Pay Uses normal react Conventions and Exposes for you a `useAtlasPay` Hook, below is an example usage

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import useAtlasPay from 'react-atlas-pay'

export default function App() {
  const [pay, atlasEvent] = useAtlasPay()

  // The useAtlasPay hook works similar to react useState, you can call the pay or atlasEvent handler anything you wish

  const config = {
    customer_email: 'john@example.com',
    description: 'test payment',
    merchant_ref: 'your_merchant_reference',
    amount: 100,
    redirect_url: '',
    payment_methods: 'card,bank_transfer,ussd,raven',
    public_key: 'your_atlas_public_key'
  }

  /**
   *  The atlasPayEvent returns and changes value based on actions carried on , on your payment window.
   *  i.e onSuccess, onLoad and onClose - this are the events you can watch for using the atlasEvent hook
   * */

  // you might want to wrap it in a useEffect to carry out action anytime the event fires

  useEffect(() => {
    if (atlasEvent.type === 'onClose') {
      // do something here if user closes the window
    }

    if (atlasEvent.type === 'onLoad') {
      // do something here if the payment window gets loaded
    }

    if (atlasEvent.type === 'onSuccess') {
      // do something here if the payment was successful i.e you can forcefully shutdown the payment window on successful payment, by default the payment window remains open on successful payment

      pay({ shutdown: true })
    }
  }, [atlasEvent])

  return (
    <div
      onClick={() => {
        pay(config)
      }}
      className=""
    >
      Pay Button
      {/* Clicking on this button will generate a payment request and initializes the payment window */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

If you don't need to generate a new payment request, 'i.e already have a payment reference', you can initialize the payment window directly py parsing the `trx_ref` as shown below.

```js
<div
  onClick={() => {
    pay({ trx_ref: 'your_payment_reference' })
  }}
  className=""
>
  {/* Clicking on this button will generate a payment request and initializes the payment window */}
</div>
```

React Atlas Pay Library can also be used in a NextJS Environment but requires extra configuration, AtlasPay offers `AtlasNext` which is NextJS Wrapper for AtlasPay to make use of this you need to call it either within your `_app.tsx` or `_document.tsx` this can be found in your nextjs `src` folder, below is an example usage;

```js

import { Manrope } from "@next/font/google";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import Head from "next/head";
import {AtlasNext} from "react-atlas-pay";

const manrope = Manrope({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {

  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      </Head>

            <main className={manrope.className}>
              <Component {...props.pageProps} />
            </main>

      <AtlasNext/>  {/* Here we instantiate the AtlasNext Wrapper */}
  );
}

```
